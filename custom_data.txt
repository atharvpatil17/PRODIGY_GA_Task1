Artificial intelligence is transforming modern technology and reshaping industries worldwide.
Machine learning enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex patterns.
Generative AI models can generate human-like text, images, and even source code.
GPT models are based on transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms.
Natural language processing allows machines to understand and generate human language.
AI applications are widely used in healthcare, finance, education, and automation.
Large language models are trained on massive datasets containing diverse text.
Fine-tuning adapts pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains.
Ethical considerations are important in the development of artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence is evolving rapidly and impacting daily life.
Machine learning algorithms improve performance as they are exposed to more data.
Transformer models process language using attention instead of recurrence.
Generative models can create new content that mimics training data.
Responsible AI development ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability.
